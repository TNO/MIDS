= Model Inference and Differencing Suite (MIDS)

The Model Inference and Differencing Suite (MIDS) provides:

* Functionality to infer multi-level models of software behavior from execution logs, to get insight into the software behavior.
* Functionality to compare behavioral models, for change impact analysis, to prevent regressions and reduce the risks for software changes.

== Documentation

For more information about MIDS, please read the link:userguide/index.html[MIDS user guide].

== Downloads

MIDS is available as a portable IDE, as command line scripts (bundled with the IDE) and as a feature for the Eclipse IDE through a P2 update site.
The MIDS IDE is portable, so just download, extract, and run it, to get started quickly.

_Windows:_

* Extract the downloaded archive somewhere on your hard disk:
** Extract to a directory where you have read and write access.
** There is no need to extract to an empty folder, as all files in the archive are contained within a root folder.
** Don't extract in too deep a path as then you may get issues with too long paths.
* Execute `mids.exe` from the directory that contains the extracted files to launch the MIDS IDE.
The `bin` directory contains the command line scripts.

_Linux:_

* Extract the downloaded archive somewhere on your hard disk:
** Extract to a directory where you have read and write access.
** There is no need to extract to an empty folder, as all files in the archive are contained within a root folder.

The `bin` directory contains the command line scripts.

.P2 update site

The MIDS P2 update site contains all plugins and features, for easy integration into OSGi-based applications.

MIDS {MIDS-version-enduser} is available as an Eclipse P2 update site:

`\https://tno.github.io/MIDS/update-site/{mids-version-enduser}/`

.Dependencies

Install the following dependencies that are required by MIDS:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| GraphViz
| https://graphviz.org

| mCLR2
| https://mcrl2.org
|===

Make sure the `bin` directories of these tools is on your `PATH`.

As part of the Constructive Model Inference process, MIDS can produce GraphML representations of the inferred models.
Because these models use specific extensions to GraphML, the intended tool to display the GraphML files is yEd.
yEd can be downloaded at link:https://www.yworks.com/products/yed[].
After yEd has been installed, GraphML models should automatically open with yEd.

.First use of MIDS

After starting the MIDS IDE, which is based on the Eclipse IDE, you'll be asked for a workspace location.
Choose a directory.
Optionally select _Use this as the default and do not ask again_ to skip this question the next time you start the product.
Confirm with btn:[OK].

On first startup, MIDS shows a _Welcome Screen_.
You may always re-open it by choosing the menu:Help[Welcome] menu.

Click the btn:[Hide] button to access the regular workbench.

The welcome screen provides easy access to key contents of the documentation:

Overview::
    Learn about basic Eclipse workbench concepts and access the complete MIDS User Guide.

What's New::
    Discover major new features of this Eclipse release and read the <<release-notes, MIDS Release Notes>>.

Memory configuration::
    MIDS is distributed with a 'max heap size' configuration of `-Xmx12g` for 12 GB.
    On some systems this may leave little memory for other processes, or more memory may be available.
    For these cases it is advised to modify this configuration in `mids.ini`.
    `mids.ini` can be edited with any text-editor.
    This configuration also applies to the command line scripts.
