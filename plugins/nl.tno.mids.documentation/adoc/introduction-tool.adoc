=== MIDS tool

MIDS is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on the http://eclipse.org[Eclipse^] IDE.
Within Eclipse, the files to work with are part of a project.
The available projects are shown in the _Project Explorer_.

TIP: MIDS provides its own Eclipse perspective configuring all recommended views to be visible.
This perspective is set by default, but can also be manually set as described in the http://help.eclipse.org/2021-12/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-9f.htm[Eclipse documentation^].

Each project is simply a directory on the hard disk, and can be expanded to show the files and directories it contains.

One way to work with files and directories is to right click on them, showing a menu with various _commands_.

For instance, it is possible to remove or rename a file, create a new file in a directory, etc.
Most of this is standard Eclipse functionality.
MIDS does provide some additional commands, specific to the functionality it provides.
Such commands are explained in more detail in other parts of this user guide.

Another way to work with files is to open them in an _editor_.
By double clicking a file, it is opened in the default editor that is associated with that file.
The specific editors available in MIDS are explained in other parts of this user guide.
