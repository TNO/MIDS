== Constructive Model Inference

Passive learning allows inferring models from (execution) traces.
If execution traces are available, access to the actual system is not required.
Since the inputs for passive learning are execution traces, the learned models are models of the executed behavior.
To obtain a model of the complete behavior of a component or system, one needs traces that cover all different parts of the system behavior.
For instance, one could combine traces from normal execution scenarios with traces from test cases that cover exceptional behavior.

MIDS supports the Constructive Model Inference (CMI) method of learning models.
Contrary to existing heuristic-based approaches, this method uses domain knowledge about the system, e.g. its architecture, communication patterns, middleware, deployment and conventions.
This knowledge is used to interpret execution traces and construct models that capture one's intuition of the system, and can be easily understood and relied upon, without configuring complex parameters.
Models can be constructed at different levels of abstraction, e.g. system, component, and interface models.

The inferred models provide valuable insight into the current software behavior.
They can can be used to bootstrap the transition to Model-Driven Engineering (MDE).
The insights they provide are also useful when making changes to the software, as it is difficult to make changes to software without understand how it behaves.
Furthermore, after you have made your changes, the models can be automatically compared, allowing for <<change-impact-analysis,change impact analysis>>.

=== Event naming scheme

For every start/end of a function call on a component, we have an event in our models.
The events are named using our naming scheme. 
The following is an overview of the scheme:

[%header,cols="1,1,1,1,1",stripes="none"]
|===
| Component identity 
| Method  
| Type of call/handler
| Return 
| Other side

| <component identity> `.`
| <interface name> `\__` <function name> `_`
| `_blk`
| [silver]_none_ (function start)
| [silver]_none_ (internal event)

2.19+|
|`_lib`
|`_ret` (function end)
|`__` <component identity>

|`_req`
2.18+|

|`_wait`

|`_fcn`

|`_fcncb`

|`_sync`

|`_async`

|`_arslt`

|`_evtsub`

|`_evtsubh`

|`_evtunsub`

|`_evtunsubh`

|`_evt`

|`_evtcb`

|`_trig`

|`_trigh`

|`_call`

|`_handler`

|`_unkn`

|===

The name always starts with the name of the first component involved.
This is the component that declares the event. It represents one of two options:

* The component on which the internal event occurs.
* The source component of a communicating event.

The name of the interface and function are added to uniquely know the identity of the software function.
They are separated by a double underscore.
The type of call or handler is added, after an additional underscore to separate it from the function name.
The following options are present:

[horizontal]
`_blk`:: A blocking call.
`_lib`:: A library call.
`_req`:: A request call.
`_wait`:: A wait call.
`_fcn`:: An FCN call.
`_fcncb`:: An FCN callback handler.
`_sync`:: A synchronous handler.
`_async`:: An asynchronous handler.
`_arslt`:: An asynchronous result call for an asynchronous handler.
`_evtsub`:: An event subscription call.
`_evtsubh`:: An event subscription handler.
`_evtunsub`:: An event unsubscription call.
`_evtunsubh`:: An event unsubscription handler.
`_evt`:: An event raise call.
`_evtcb`:: An event callback handler.
`_trig`:: A trigger call.
`_trigh`:: A trigger handler.
`_call`:: An abstract call.
`_handler`:: An abstract handler.
`_unkn`:: An unknown call/handler, e.g. due to this host being untraced.

For every function call there is the start and end of that function call. 
The end of a function call gets an additional `_ret` (for "`return`") added to its name.
In case the event represents communication to another component, the following applies:

* The type of the other side and `_ret` if applicable, are also added for the other side.
* The identity of the component on the other side is added, if it does not involve communication to itself (e.g. multiple servers deployed on a single OS process or thread).
It is separated from the event type by a double underscore.
* If two runtime components (OS processes/threads) are involved, the order is chronological.
That is, the first component starts the communication.
The first type and `_ret` apply to that component.
The second type and `_ret` apply to the receiving component, the second component identity is the receiving component.
The name reads from left to right chronologically, as: "`this component calls this function in this way and it is handled in this way by the other component`".

For two events connected by a dependency, the CIF event will be the same for both events, to ensure they synchronize.
E.g. `Component1.SomeInterface\__some_function__blk_sync__Component2`.

For more information about the communication patterns, see link:https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-19756-7_13[this scientific paper] (primarily Section 4.1).

=== Inferring models

In order to perform CMI, you can use the `mids-cmi` command-line tool.

The CMI tool has a number of configurable options.
The tool provides a list of available options if used with the `-h` or `-help` option.

The first parameter configures which trace data is used to infer models.
Providing the input path is required to perform CMI.

Input file (`-i` or `-input`)::
Constructive Model Inference takes a <<import,TMSC>>, i.e. a `.tmscz` file, as input.

This means the basic command to run the CMI tool is `mids-cmi -i some-folder/input.tmscz` or `mids-cmi -input some-folder/input.tmscz`.
By default, the CMI tool will put the resulting models in a folder called `cmi` next to the input TMSC file.
If such a folder does not exist, it will be created by the tool.

To customize the CMI process and the output, a number of other options are available.
The other available options are:

Output folder (`-o` or `-output`)::
The output of CMI is stored in the location specified.
If the provided path does not describe an existing folder, a new folder will be created.
Specify this option to override the default output folder location.

Save yEd diagrams (`-y` or `-yed`)::
By default, only CIF files are written for the inferred models.
If the _Save yEd diagrams_ option is enabled, in addition to CIF models, yEd visualizations of the final models are also generated.
These can be used to inspect the models, to get insight into the software behavior.
yEd can be downloaded at https://www.yworks.com/products/yed.

Infer protocol between two components (`-p` or `-protocol`)::
The output of model inference is either component models or a single protocol model.
By default, one or more component models are created.
If this option is enabled, the output is instead a single protocol model representing communication between a pair of components.
If protocol inference is chosen, two components have to be selected as communicating parties in the protocol.
Components can be selected by providing the two component names as argument of the option, separated by a comma.
Note that computing the protocol can be very memory-intensive and time-consuming.
Protocol models are always prefix-closed.

Additional protocol scope components (`-ps` or `-protocolscope`)::
If the option to infer a protocol is chosen, extra context components can be added to the scope of the protocol computation, as a comma separated list of component names.
These additional components will not be directly present in the final protocol, but will be taken into account to determine the allowed order of events in the protocol.
Note that adding extra components increases the memory and time requirements of the computation.
If component models are being inferred rather than a protocol, this option will be ignored.

Do not convert events on untraced components to synchronous functions (`-u` or `-no-untraced-synchronous`)::
By default for each component that is untraced, superfluous events and dependencies that link the start and end of a synchronous function are removed.
This reduces the size of the models makes further analysis easier.
If combining the dependency information to form a single event is undesired, this option can be used to disable it.

Do not synchronize dependent (`-d` or `-no-sync-dependent`)::
As part of the transformation of TMSC events to CIF events, the component initiating the event has to be identified.
By default, for communicating events information from the source and target of the corresponding dependency is combined into a single CIF event.
Otherwise, only local information is used for the CIF event.
If this behavior is undesired, this option can be used to disable it.
Note that unless you want to use explicit middleware models, disabling the synchronization is not recommended.

Save single model (`-s` or `-single-model`)::
By default, each component model created by Constructive Model Inference is stored in a separate CIF model.
If this option is selected, a single CIF model containing all components is created instead.
When inferring a protocol model rather than component models, this option is ignored. 
Additionally, if the option to generate yEd diagrams is enabled, this option has no effect on that, as always only a single diagram is constructed for all components.

Component exclusion regex (`-ce` or `-component-exclusion`)::
Component inclusion regex (`-ci` or `-component-inclusion`)::
Filtering can be applied by including and/or excluding components based on their name.
A filter consists of a Java regular expression provided as argument to the option, which will be matched against all component names.
For a component exclusion filter, components matching the pattern will be rejected.
For a component inclusion filter, components not matching the pattern will be rejected.
Models for components removed by filtering are discarded and will not be processed further or stored.
There can be at most one exclusion filter and one inclusion filter defined.

Perform post-processing operation (`-c` or `-post-processing`)::
Furthermore, post-processing operations can be applied to the inferred models.
Each operation added will be applied to the models in the order they are listed on the command line.
Each operation can require a certain precondition or result in a certain postcondition with regard to the existence or lack of data and/or tau events in the inferred models.
If a precondition for an operation is not satisfied, the operation may fail, e.g. when an operation requires tau events to be present, but they are not present.
Operations may also eliminate certain concepts automatically, if they don't support them. E.g. data may be eliminated if an operation only works for models without data.
Note that as part of post-processing the number of models may increase or decrease.
+
To add a post-processing operation, its name and any required arguments must be supplied.
It is possible to add multiple operations by supplying the option multiple times.
For most operations, it is possible to configure to which components they are applied with filtering.
Filtering is defined by adding `<filter-mode,filter-pattern>` before the operation name.
Filter mode has to be either `inclusion` or `exclusion`, and the `filter-pattern` has to be a Java regular expression for matching component names.
During processing, each component name is matched against the `filter-pattern` provided.
If the `filter-mode` is `inclusion`, the operation is applied to components that match the pattern, and not applied to those that do not.
If the `filter-mode` is `exclusion`, the filtering is reversed.
As a basic example, if the argument `ModifyRepetitions(data,0,0,false,0)` is supplied, the ModifyRepetitions operation is applied to all models with the provided arguments.
If `<inclusion,ABC.\*>ModifyRepetitions(data,0,0,false,0)` is supplied instead, the operation is only applied to the components with names that fit the pattern `ABC.*`, i.e. that start with `ABC`.
In contrast, if `<exclusion,ABC.*>ModifyRepetitions(data,0,0,false,0)` is supplied, the operation is only applied to components with names that do not fit the pattern.
+
The following post-processing operations are available:

AddAsynchronousPatternConstraints:::
Add constraints that enforce that asynchronous replies happen after the corresponding request, and that each asynchronous request results in a corresponding reply before the same request is made again.
Also allows such constraints to be visualized in the yEd diagrams.
This operation requires no configuration.
This operation can be selectively applied based on filtering.

ExcludeInternalTransitions:::
Remove transitions from the models that do not represent a communication between two components.
For the purpose of this transformation, events on transitions to and from the initial state (the start and end of service fragments) will always be considered communication.
Note that this means transitions with those events will not be removed, even elsewhere in the state machine.
This operation requires no configuration.
This operation can be selectively applied based on filtering.

FilterClientServerInteractions(`component1`, `component2`):::
Remove all service fragments that are not involved in communication between two specified components.
The operation has to be configured with two components, which should communicate for the output to be useful.
This operation can _not_ be selectively applied based on filtering.

HideActions(`pattern`):::
Remove all actions fitting a given Java regular expression pattern from the models.
This operation has to be configured with a pattern to define actions that should be hidden.
In order to keep models consistent, events on transitions to and from the initial state (the start and end of service fragments) will never be hidden.
Note that this means transitions with those events will not be removed, even elsewhere in the state machine.
This operation can be selectively applied based on filtering.

InjectDomainKnowledge(`operator`, `model-path`):::
Combine inferred models with a domain knowledge model.
This operation can be configured by providing a path to the domain knowledge model, which must be a CIF model, and selecting the operator that will be used to add the domain knowledge to the inferred models.
+
WARNING: Injecting unsuitable domain knowledge can cause following operations to malfunction and fail.
+
The available operations are `intersection`, `union`, `difference-left`, `difference-right`, `exclusive-or` and `parallel-composition`.
Suppose we have the domain knowledge model `/domain.cif`:
+
--
* `InjectDomainKnowledge(intersection,some-folder/domain.cif)` would compute the behavior present in both the CMI model and the domain knowledge model.
* `InjectDomainKnowledge(union,some-folder/domain.cif)` would compute the behavior present in either the CMI model or the domain knowledge model, or in both.
* `InjectDomainKnowledge(difference-left,some-folder/domain.cif)` would compute the behavior present in the domain knowledge model, but not in the CMI model.
* `InjectDomainKnowledge(difference-right,some-folder/domain.cif)` would compute the behavior present in the CMI model, but not in the domain knowledge model.
* `InjectDomainKnowledge(exclusive-or,some-folder/domain.cif)` would compute the behavior present in either the CMI model and the domain knowledge model, but not in both.
* `InjectDomainKnowledge(parallel-composition,some-folder/domain.cif)` would compute the behavior created by executing the CMI model and the domain knowledge model in parallel, synchronizing on common labels.
--
This operation can be selectively applied based on filtering.

MergeComponents:::
Merge multiple runtime components, for instance multiple instances of the same executable, into a single runtime component.
E.g. merge `SomeComponent1`, `SomeComponent2`, etc into `SomeComponent`, ignoring the details of what is handled by which instance of the component (e.g., OS process or thread).
Variants of a component are considered part of the same instance, so e.g. `SomeComponent_1` and `SomeComponent_2` would be merged into `SomeComponent` as well.
Additionally, untraced components are never merged with traced components.
This operation has to be configured with a Java regular expression pattern to match component names of components that should be merged, and to determine the name of the merged component.
For instance, `(?<name>\\w+XX)\\d+` will match components `abcXX1`, `abcXX2`, `defXX34`, `defXX71`, etc.
And `abcXX1` and `abcXX2` will be merged to `abcXX`, while `defXX34` and `defXX71` will be merged to `defXX`.
If filtering is used with this operation, only components included in the filtered models will be merged together.
References to the merged components are updated in all models, even if they are not in the filtered set.

MergeInterfaceClientsServers(`interface-name`, `merge-clients`, `merge-servers`):::
Event names contain the identify of the client and server, as well as the client call type (blocking call, library call, FCN call, request/wait calls) and server handling type (synchronous, asynchronous).
This can be useful to understand the communication between components.
However, when comparing behavior, it may be useful to hide such details, and focus on the behavior of the component itself, rather than such details of the environment.
This can reduce the number of (irrelevant) differences.
+
This transformation hides the client/server component identities, replacing them with the interface name, which then serves as the 'merged' single identity of the various clients/servers.
It also hides the client call type and server handling type, replacing it with an abstract type (call, handler), which then serves as the 'merged' single type for all call/handler types.
This transformation can be applied to either all interfaces or a specific one, and for communications with clients only, for communication with servers only, or for both.
If an interface name is provided, only that interface will be merged.
If the interface name is empty, all interfaces will be merged.
The boolean options `merge-clients` and `merge-servers` enable or disable the merging of clients and servers respectively.
So the operation configuration `MergeInterfaceClientsServers(ABC,true,false)` would merge clients of the `ABC` interface, while `MergeInterfaceClientsServers(ABC,false,true)` would merge the servers of the `ABC` interface.
The configuration `MergeInterfaceClientsServers(,true,true)` merges all clients and servers for all interfaces.
Given that certain details are abstracted away, the result of this transformation can no longer be used to compose component models and form a system model.
This operation can be selectively applied based on filtering.

ModifyRepetitions(`mode`, `lower-threshold`, `upper-threshold`, `make-infinite`, `max-repeats`):::
Detect repetitions in inferred models and modify their representations.
This operation can be configured by selecting which repetitions it will apply to, and how each repetition will be processed.
The `mode` determines how repetitions are encoded in the models, either using edges only (`plain`) or using variables and edges with guards and updates (`data`).
Repetitions can be selected based on a minimum and maximum number of repetitions.
If a threshold is set to 0, it will be ignored.
Repetitions can be modified by changing the number of repetitions, either to infinite, by setting `make-infinite` to `true`, or limiting to a given maximum (`max-repeats`).
Note that if `max-repeats` is 0, it will not be used as a limit, and if `make-infinite` is enabled, `max-repeats` must be 0.
This operation can be selectively applied based on filtering.

PrefixClose:::
Extend the language described by inferred models with all prefixes. 
This post-processing is required for change impact analysis based on the inferred models.
This operation requires no configuration.
This operation can be selectively applied based on filtering.

RenameComponent(`old-name`, `new-name`):::
Renames any component based on a specified old name and new name.
This rename fails if it causes clashes with other existing component names.
This operation can _not_ be selectively applied based on filtering.

RenameFunctions(`functionMappings`):::
Renames functions based on a mapping of old names to new names.
Function mappings have to be provided in the form `<old-interface>:<old-function>\-><new-interface>:<new-function>`.
For example, `OldInterface:old_function\->NewInterface:new_function` renames the `old_function` function of the `OldInterface` interface to the `new_function` function of the `NewInterface` interface.
Multiple function mappings can be provided, separated by either commas or newlines.
Note that the operation does not check whether the new function name already exists.
If multiple mappings are provided for the same function, only the first mapping will be applied.
This operation can _not_ be selectively applied based on filtering.

Options file (`-f` or `-options-file`)::
In addition to command line options, settings can be provided in an options file.
An options file should be a text file contain one or more CMI options.
Each option and each argument should be on a separate line.
As an exception, the options file option itself will be ignored if used in an options file.
At the end of each run, the CMI tool produces a `component-extraction-options.txt` file containing the settings for that run, which can be used to repeat the run.
Option values defined on the command line take precedence over values defined in the options file.

Additionally, it is possible to configure the JVM used to run the tool by using the `-vmargs` option, followed by the desired JVM options. 
For example, the `-Xmx` option can be used to increase the available memory space, which may be needed when importing large datasets.
By adding `-vmargs -Xmx20G` to the command line the memory the tool can use will be set to 20 gigabytes.
JVM options can only be added on the command line, not as part of an options file.
Additionally, any options after the `-vmargs` option will be interpreted as a JVM option, so they must be added at the end of the command line.
For information on which JVM options are available, please consult the documentation of the JVM in question.

=== Model inference in the MIDS UI

It is possible to perform Constructive Model Inference in the MIDS UI for a TMSC, i.e. a `.tmscz` file, that is present in the workspace.
Right click the TMSC file and choose _Construct CIF Models_ and then _Construct component models_.

image::{imgsdir}/cmi-component-menu.png[]

The construction process can also be configured through the same options that are available for the command-line interface.
These can be configured in the dialog that is shown.

image::{imgsdir}/cmi-component-dialog.png[]

A separate dialog is available to configure post-processing operations.

image::{imgsdir}/cmi-dialog-postprocessing.png[]

In case a sequence of operations is defined where the preconditions of an operation are not met, or one operation directly affects or removes features added by another, warnings will be given.
Note that the warnings are computed statically, and since post-processing operations may be applied to only some of the components, some warnings may be false positive.

=== Model inference report

Constructive Model Inference produces a file `component_extraction_report.txt` containing a brief report of the model inference process.
This file for example includes the running time of the model inference process.

=== Repeat inference process

Constructive Model Inference produces a `component-extraction-options.txt` file as part of its output.
This file can be used to repeat the inference with the same settings.
Right click the options file, select _Construct CIF models_ and then choose _Construct component models_.

image::{imgsdir}/cmi-component-repeat.png[]
