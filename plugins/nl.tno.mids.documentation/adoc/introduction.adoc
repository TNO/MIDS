The Model Inference and Differencing Suite (MIDS) can be used to infer software behavior models from existing software components.
The models provide insight into the current software behavior.
They can also be used to bootstrap the introduction of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), reducing the need for laborious and error-prone manual modelling.
Furthermore, the software behavior (models) of different software versions can be compared to find differences, detect regressions and reduce risks for software changes, such as patches and redesigns.
MIDS allows performing all this in a single integrated environment.
The ultimate goal is to improve the efficiency of software development and re-engineering, and reduce risks for software evolution.

MIDS can be downloaded at https://tno.github.io/MIDS/[^].

The documentation in this user manual is split into several chapters, together explaining how to work with MIDS:

<<mids-concepts>>::
Introduction to the concepts that are used within MIDS and a first overview of the tool.

<<import>>::
Discusses Timed Message Sequence Charts (TMSCs), the input required for MIDS.

<<cmi>>::
Discusses Constructive Model Inference (CMI) to infer software behavior (models).

<<change-impact-analysis>>::
Discusses change impact analysis by comparing software behaviors of different software versions.

<<release-notes>>::
The release notes of the various MIDS releases.
