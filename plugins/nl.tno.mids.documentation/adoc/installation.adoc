=== Installing MIDS

The MIDS tool suite is available as an archive that can be downloaded, extracted, and used as a portable application.
To download MIDS, go to the MIDS download page: +
http://TBD/[^]

==== Installing MIDS on Windows

The MIDS version for 64-bit versions of Windows comes with all MIDS functionality pre-installed.

Create a new folder and extract the downloaded '.zip' file to the folder.
Double click the `eclipse.exe` file, the tool suite will start.

==== Installing MIDS on Linux

The MIDS version for 64-bit versions of Linux comes with all MIDS functionality pre-installed.
However, to function properly, some functionality requires additional tools to be installed separately.
Install GraphViz, available at https://graphviz.org.
Also install mCRL2, available at https://www.mcrl2.org.

Create a new folder and extract the downloaded '.tar.gz' file to the folder.
Double click the `eclipse` file, the tool suite will start.

==== MIDS first use

After starting the MIDS UI, which is based on the Eclipse IDE, you'll be asked for a workspace location.
Choose a directory.
Optionally select _Use this as the default and do not ask again_ to skip this question the next time you start the product.
Confirm with btn:[OK].

On first startup, MIDS shows a _Welcome Screen_.
You may always re-open it by choosing the menu:Help[Welcome] menu.

You need to click on the btn:[Hide] button in order to access the regular workbench.

The welcome screen provides easy access to key contents of the documentation:

Overview::
    Learn about basic Eclipse workbench concepts and access the complete MIDS User Guide.

What's New::
    Discover major new features of this Eclipse release and read the <<release-notes, MIDS Release Notes>>.

Memory configuration::
    MIDS is distributed with a 'max heap size' configuration of `-Xmx12g` for 12 GB.
    On some systems this may leave little memory for other processes, or more memory may be available.
    For these cases it is advised to modify this configuration in `eclipse.ini`.
    `eclipse.ini` can be edited with any text-editor. 

=== Installing yEd

As part of the Constructive Model Inference process, MIDS can produce GraphML representations of the inferred models.
Because these models use specific extensions to GraphML, the intended tool to display the GraphML files is yEd.
yEd can be downloaded at https://www.yworks.com/products/yed.
After yEd has been installed, it will automatically be used to open the GraphML models.
